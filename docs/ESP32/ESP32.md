### Project 4: Programmable Buttons & Touch

![img](img/26.png)

#### 1. Introduction

Buttons can be used to control circuits. In an integrated circuit with a button, the circuit is connected when the button is pressed and if you release the button, the circuit is open.

Capacitive touch detects the user's operation by measuring changes in capacitance. When you touchg the capacitive sensing area, the charge of the human body affects the value of the capacitor, which can be sensed by the module due to this change.

ESP32 Easy Coding Board boasts three buttons: two programmable buttons (marked with A and B), and a reset button at back. By pressing the two programmable buttons, three different signals can be input. We can press button A or B or both so that the LED dot matrix shows A, B and AB respectively. 

Let’s get started!

### Project 5: Passive Buzzer

![img](img/60.png)

#### 1. Introduction

The board boasts an built-in passive buzzer, which is a device without an oscillating circuit so need an external driving signal to produce sound.

- **Passive:** Unlike active buzzers, passive buzzers do not include a built-in oscillator circuit, so an external driving signal with a certain frequency is required. This is usually done by a microcontroller or other signal source.
- **Frequency control:** The frequency of the driving signal determines the frequency at which the buzzer produces sound. By changing the frequency of the input signals, different tones of sound can be played.
- **Applications:** Passive buzzers are widely used in various electronic devices to provide audio prompts or alerts, such as embedded systems, electronic products, alarm systems, etc.
- **Driving:** Due to its passiveness, they have relatively low requirements for external drive signals, so they usually only need to provide enough current and the appropriate frequency.

### Project 8: MPU6050 Accelerometer and Gyroscope

![img](img/43.png)

#### 1. Introduction

The MPU6050 is a six-axis motion processor that includes a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer. Two sensors integrated on a single chip that can detect static and dynamic object motion states, including angular speed, Angle and acceleration.

The MPU6050 is integrated with a 16-bit ADC that can simultaneously read data from six axes to measure diagonal speed and Angle, and can also infer acceleration information from the object. The MPU6050 also boasts a built-in temperature sensor used to measure the temperature of the chip, helping to monitor the temperature of the sensor during operation.

In addition, the MPU6050 is equipped with a fast Digital Motion Processor (DMP), which helps process raw data from the gyroscope and accelerometer to obtain the motion state of the object.

-------------------

**Typical circuit diagram:**

![img](img/51.png)

|  #   | NAME | DESCRIPTION                                                  |
| :--: | :--: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1   | GND  | Negative interface (0V).                                     |
|  2   | VCC  | Positive interface (3.3V or 5V).                             |
|  3   | SDA  | I2C data line, connected to MCU, used to transmit data.      |
|  4   | SCL  | I2C clock line, connected to MCU, used to synchronize data transmission. |
|  5   | XDA  | I2C data line, connected to external extension sensors, used to transmit data. |
|  6   | XCL  | I2C clock line, connected to external extension sensors, used to synchronize data transmission. |
|  7   | AD0  | I2C Slave address. The sensor address is 0x69 at high and 0x68 at low. |
|  8   | INT  | External interrupt pin, detects the internal interrupt time of the MPU6050. |

- Operating voltage: 3.3V, 5V
- Static current: 5μA
- Rotating current: 3mA
- Maximum rotation speed: 2000°/s
- Acceleration range: ±2g, ±4g, ±8g, ±16g
- Temperature range: –10 ~ +65°C

------------------

MPU6050 can be used to measure the attitude of an object. Measurements of three angles can be provided: **roll**, **pitch** and **yaw**. It can also provide the acceleration of the object, and obtain the speed and position information of the object through calculation.

**Its three axises:**

![img](img/52.png)

![img](img/53.png)

The corresponding **Euler Angle** indicates the Angle of rotation of the object in three-dimensional space, and its coordinate axis can be adjusted arbitrarily.

Euler Angle consists of three angles, namely **Roll**, **Pitch** and **Yaw**.

|   Roll    |   Rotation Angle with x-axis as rotation axis   |
| :-------: | :---------------------------------------------: |
| **Pitch** | **Rotation Angle with y-axis as rotation axis** |
|  **Yaw**  | **Rotation Angle with z-axis as rotation axis** |

![img](img/54.png)

When acquiring Yaw, the gyroscope inside the MPU6050 is automatically calibrated to zero, which causes Yaw to drift to zero.

**Zero drift** means that the detected data will have an accidental small fluctuation, for example, the sensor value will automatically have an accidental small change. Even after a good algorithm, zero drift still exists, as it is limited by hardware. 

Solution: add a magnetometer to calibrate the MPU6050.

### Project 9: Light Brightness

![img](img/55.png)

#### 1. Introduction

Photoresistors measure light intensity and are commonly used to detect brightness in the surrounding environment.

**Working principle:** This module is designed by the light-sensitive materials. There are two main types: photoresistor and photodiode.

- **Photoresistor:** The resistance of a photoresistor varies with the intensity of ambient light. For one photoresistor, the stronger the ambient light is, the lower the resistance will be.
- **Photodiode:** The current output of a photodiode is proportional to the intensity of the incident light. The electrical signals they produce can be used to measure light brightness.

**Applications:** Photoresistors are widely applied to various fields, including light control systems, lighting systems, camera exposure control, light monitoring, automatic adjustment of screen brightness, etc.

**Unit of brightness:** They usually measure light intensity in illuminance units (such as Lux). Illuminance represents the luminous flux per unit area.

### Project 11: Read ESP32 Easy Coding Board Current

![img](img/164.png)

#### 1. Introduction

ESP32 Easy Coding Board boasts a built-in current measurement module (only measure USB power supply and PH2.0 interface power supply) to measure current by a resistive current sensor. 

Resistive current sensor is commonly used to monitor the current value by measuring the voltage drop generated by the current through the resistance. The working principle of such sensors is based on Ohm's law, which states that when a current passes through a resistor, the voltage generated at both ends of the resistor is proportional to the current.

![img](img/165.png)

- **Current sensing:** Resistive current sensor contains a current sensing element, usually, a resistor. When current passes through this resistor, a voltage drop will be generated at both ends of the resistor, the magnitude of which is proportional to the strength of the current.
- **Volateg output:** By measuring the voltage drop at both ends of the resistor, the sensor can provide a voltage signal that is related to current. This voltage signal can be digitally processed by devices like an analog-to-digital converters (ADC).

Resistive current sensors are widely applied to power system monitoring, power consumption measurement of electronic devices, electric vehicle current monitoring and so on.

**Complete code:**

![img](img/167.png)

#### 5. Test Result 1

After uploading test code, open the serial monitor and you will see the current value is 0. Because many modules are not working on the board, so the current is close to 0.

![img](img/168.png)

#### 6. Test Code 2

Enable RGB dot matrix and then measure the current value.

Initialize the seial monitor and RGB dot matrix.

![img](img/169.png)

First measure 10 RGB beads.

![img](img/170.png)

Then measure 18 RGB beads.

![img](img/171.png)

Last measure 25 RGB beads.

![img](img/172.png)

**Complete code:**

![img](img/174.png)

#### 7. Test Result 2

Upload test code and you will find that the more the beads are, the larger the current will be.

![img](img/173.png)

#### 8. Test Code 3

The conversion of current to power: power (P) equals current (I) times voltage (V).

​					**P = IV**

- *P* is power, unit: Watt(W)
- *I* is current, unit: ampere(A)
- *V* is voltage, unit: volt(V)

This formula is suitable for DC circuits. 

For AC circuits, power calculation may require more complex formulas due to power factor.

In a circuit, power describes the conversion of electrical energy. Input current and voltage values into the above formula and you can get real-time power values. 

This is commonly used for energy monitoring, power system management and equipment power consumption evaluation.

The power voltage of ESP32 Easy Coding Board is 3.3V, so we only need to measure the current and multiply it by 3.3 to get the power of the Board at this time.

**Find code blocks:**

Create valriables **P** and **I**.


![img](img/175.png)

![img](img/176.png)

![img](img/177.png)

Assign the read current value to variable I.

![img](img/178.png)

I multiplies by 3.3 is power of the ESP32 Easy Coding Board(the board voltage is 3.3V).

![img](img/181.png)

**Complete code:**

![img](img/183.png)

#### 9. Test Result 3

Upload code and open serial monitor to set baud rate. The more the beads are, the greater the current value and power will be.

## 4. ESP32 Easy Coding Board Button Piano Projects

### 4.1 Introduce to Piano

In this project, you will embark on the journey of piano exploration. With eight buttons connected on the board and each one corresponding to one tone, we will learn how to build a basic piano that may open the door to a wonderful world of tone.

![img](img/67.png)

---------

#### 1. Music Theory

The piano is versatile and usually consists of 88 keys, covering a wide vocal range. **Tone** is the basis of music, which is represented by black and white keys on the piano. In music theory, there are seven basic tones: C, D, E, F, G, A, B. They make up the **scale** for multiple musical compositions.

1. **C(Do)**
	- On pianos, C is white key at the most left side. 
	- C is the beginning note of the scale and the first note in the diatonic scale.
	- C major: C D E F G A B C

2. **D(Re)**
	- D is the white key next to C.
	- D is the second note in scale.
	- D major: D E F# G A B C# D。

3. **E(Mi)**
	- E is the white key next to D.
	- E is the third note in scale.
	- E major: E F# G# A B C# D# E。

4. **F(Fa)**
	- F is the white key next to E.
	- F is the forth note in scale.
	- F major: F G A Bb C D E F。

5. **G(Sol)**
	- G is the white key next to F.
	- G is the fifth note in scale.
	- G major: G A B C D E F# G。

6. **A(La)**
	- A is the white key next to G.
	- A is the sixth note in scale.
	- A major: A B C# D E F# G# A。

7. **B(Si)**
	- B is the white key next to A.
	- B is the seventh note in scale.
	- B major: B C# D# E F# G# A# B。

These seven basic tones and the interstitial relationships among them form the basis of music. With these tones, different scales, chords and melodies can be composed. Beyond that, semitone and whole tone are also included to have a better understanding of more complex aspects of music. Learning music theory can help piano players perform compositions.
